What sort of things would you like? <utt> B: Just a light lunch I think, so that people can eat while they move around and talk to each other. You did some thing similar for us last year. We'd be happy to have the same menu again. <utt> A: Right. I'll look at my diary and see what you had last time. Oh, I nearly forgot to ask you how many should I cater for? <utt> B: Well, I think most people will be able to come, perhaps around 30.
