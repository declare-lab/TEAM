{"context": "How to Set Up a Planted Aquarium", "choice0": "There are aquatic plants that will live in pretty much any aquarium, so it just takes a little research to find plants that will work in yours. The first thing you need to add is substrate. For a heavily planted tank with more demanding species of plants, there are special aquarium soils that come in different sized granules. For less demanding species, you can just use sand. Build up the substrate in the back of the tank to add some dimension, and have it lower in the front. You want to avoid making your substrate too deep because you can end up with spots of anaerobic bacteria and gas pockets. Lay a plastic shopping bag over top of the substrate and add the water, pouring on the bag to keep sand from being washed into the water column. Plant taller background plants in the back of the tank, careful not to block where the filter and heater will go, and medium sized plants in the midground, and short or carpeting plants in the front. Make sure your aquarium light is of adequate intensity and spectrum for the plants you have selected. Do water changes of 20% every other day for the first 2 or 3 weeks after starting your aquarium to manage diatoms and remove decaying plant matter and mulm. Do not fertilize during this period, and if your light has a dimmer, its a good idea to reduce the intensity until the plants have a change to acclimate. This will help avoid any unwanted algae issues.", "choice1": "There are aquatic plants that will live in pretty much any aquarium, so it just takes a little research to find plants that will work in yours.
